# Ramsey theory :art:

This is a work-in-progress formalization of Ramsey Theory in
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/).

## Constructive :construction: Proofs

Constructive versions of Ramsey's Theorem are studied in 
> Wim Veldman and Marc Bezem, Ramsey's Theorem and the Pigeon Hole
> Principle in intuitionistic mathematics, Journal of the London
> Mathematical Society (2), Vol. 47, April 1993, pp. 193-211.

Additionally, the constructive version of the infinite pidgeon hole principle was
[proved in coq](https://github.com/coq-contribs/ramsey).
An adaptation of this proof is given in `src/constructive/pigeon.lean`.

## Classical :violin: Proofs
